### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Required Role |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `POST` | `/auth` | Get authentication token | None |
| `GET` | `/api/employee` | Retrieve all employees | User, Editor, Admin |

| `PUT` | `/api/employee/:id` | Update employee by ID | Editor, Admin |
| `DELETE` | `/api/employee/:id` | Delete employee by ID | Admin only |

## Data Storage

Employee data is stored in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "firstname": "Jane",
    "lastname": "Smith"
  }
]
```

## Authentication

### Getting Bearer Token
First, you need to authenticate by making a POST request to `/auth` to obtain a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
  }' \
  http://localhost:3000/auth
```

### Using Bearer Token
All API requests require a valid Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```

### Example Request
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
     -X GET \
     http://localhost:3000/api/employee
```
